  <!-- 介绍 -->
  <h1>Welcome to lamp23333's website!</h1>
  <p>I’ve always wanted to have a personal website, but I was often held back by the recurring costs of registering a formal domain and paying for web hosting—until I discovered GitHub Pages.</p>
  <p>Honestly, I hate myself for not finding out earlier that GitHub could do something like this.</p>
  <p>I’m a high school student from China, passionate about technology, innovation, gaming, anime, electronic music, and my life. I admire the extraordinary young creators out there and want to become someone like them.</p>
  <p>Right now, I don’t have the skills to support my ambitions. I can’t code, draw, make music, develop games, or manage a team. I’m willing to give everything to learn, but like any ordinary high school student in China, I’m caught up in a busy academic schedule, intense competition, external pressures, and a modest family background. It might seem like I’m just an armchair strategist, but I really don’t have the ability or the justification to do what I want to do right now, because the “Gaokao” <i style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">(China’s National College Entrance Examination, or NCEE) </i>is right in front of me. That's almost the only way for me to establish myself in society and pursue my dreams.</p>
  <p>Still, perhaps to get closer to my goals a little sooner, I’ve started preparing from now. Maybe out of a desire to share, I created this site and put my work here—even though hardly anyone might see it.</p>
  <p>I said I can’t do anything, so where does my work come from? Well, it’s AI-generated.</p>
  <p>Although I don’t believe AI can replace all creation, when it comes to turning conceptual ideas into tangible content, I have to admit AI is incredibly useful. But in the future, if I ever truly commit to creating, I won’t rely on it.</p>
  <p>That’s all I wanted to say. I hope anyone who visits can understand—and maybe forgive—the naive and perhaps laughable ideas I’m sharing here.</p>
  <p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
